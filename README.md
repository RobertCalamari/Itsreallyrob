This is a website that is about me. It is a portfolio where anyone can view everything that I create, whether it be a website, painting, or a game. It will also include a blog that I will post in progressing my coding experiences each day while I participate in a 100 day coding challange. The challange is where i just code for at least an hour or more a day for 100 days.

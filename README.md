Live site: <a href='https://robertcalamari.com'>https://robertcalamari.com</a>

This site is my personal portfolio. It has my paintings, projects, and my blog. Everything is coded from scratch using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I am currently hosting it off of github. The point of this site is to showcase what I can do by updating a blog on whenever I code. This is my first official site and project. Through this you will also be able to see my other projects.
